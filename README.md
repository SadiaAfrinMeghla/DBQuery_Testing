# DBQueryTesting

A comprehensive repository dedicated to database testing, essential for ensuring the integrity and performance of databases throughout the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).

Database testing is a crucial aspect of the SDLC, as it ensures that the database system is reliable, secure, and performs well. Key reasons include ensuring data integrity, optimizing performance, verifying security, validating functionality, and ensuring compliance with relevant regulations and standards. This repository covers various database testing scenarios using applications like XAMPP, SQLyog, DBeaver, and PostgreSQL.

## Why Database Testing is Important in SDLC

Database testing ensures that data remains accurate, consistent, and reliable. It identifies and resolves performance bottlenecks, verifies that the database is secure from unauthorized access and vulnerabilities, ensures that all database operations work as expected, and ensures compliance with relevant regulations and standards.

## Applications Used

- **XAMPP**: A free and open-source cross-platform web server solution stack package.
- **SQLyog**: A GUI tool for RDBMS, a powerful tool for database management and development.
- **DBeaver**: A free multi-platform database tool for developers, database administrators, analysts, and all people who need to work with databases.
- **PostgreSQL**: A powerful, open-source object-relational database system.

## Database Query Assignment

### Database Query Assignment
In this assignment, several key operations were performed:

1. Created a database `database_assignment`.
2. Created a table `customers` with fields for customer information.
3. Inserted sample data into the `customers` table.
4. Queried the database to show all databases and the `customers` table.
5. Selected members with points greater than 1000, limited to 2 results.
6. Found customers born between 1980 and 1990 or with points less than 1000.
7. Searched for customers with 'burgh' in their name using a regular expression.
8. Identified customers without a phone number.
9. Counted the number of customers by state.
10. Identified the customer with the maximum points.
